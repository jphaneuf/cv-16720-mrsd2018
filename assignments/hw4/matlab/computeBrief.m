function [locs, desc] = computeBrief(im, locs, compareX, compareY)
% Compute the BRIEF descriptor for detected keypoints.
% im is 1 channel image, 
% locs are locations
% compareX and compareY are idx in patchWidth^2
% Return:
% locs: m x 2 vector which contains the coordinates of the keypoints
% desc: m x nbits vector which contains the BRIEF descriptor for each
%   keypoint.
